This project is an interactive digital interpretation of Yoko Ono’s Cloud Piece from Grapefruit. Inspired by her instruction to “imagine the clouds dripping” and “dig a hole to put them in,” the piece reimagines clouds as soft, ethereal entities that gently drift and drip downwards into a glowing hole. Users can click to add clouds, each uniquely rendered with soft gradients, subtle movement, and a natural, layered appearance that evokes a peaceful, dreamlike atmosphere. The background shifts smoothly from morning to evening colors, creating a tranquil day-to-night cycle that enhances the calming tone of the piece.

This interpretation connects to the homework’s goal of reimagining a Fluxus-inspired score as an interactive, evolving digital experience. By allowing users to create clouds and watch them dissolve, the project embodies the Fluxus principle of audience participation, making each interaction unique. The piece is also time-based, as the day-to-night background and drifting clouds are in constant, subtle motion, transforming the scene into a meditative experience that is both engaging and poetic, much like Ono’s original instruction.
